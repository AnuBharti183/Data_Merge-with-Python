# Data_Merge-with-Python
## Project Title: Data Cleaning & Merging for Analysis Using Python
### Objective
To demonstrate data cleaning, transformation, and merging skills by preparing multiple raw datasets for analysis. This project focused on creating a clean, analysis-ready dataset from fragmented and inconsistent data sources using Python (Pandas). The clean dataset was later structured for advanced analysis through SQL and visualization tools.
### Data Source
Kaggle: European Fashion Store Multi-Table Dataset included customer, campaign, sales, products, stock, and sales items tables.

### Tools & Technologies
* Python (Pandas): Data Cleaning, Transformation, Merging
* Jupyter Notebook: Documentation of Process and Workflow
* SQL (Post-cleaning): Analysis Preparation

### Project Workflow
#### Data Loading & Exploration (Python)
* Imported multiple CSV files representing different tables.
* Assessed data quality, structure, and column relevancy.

#### Data Cleaning (Pandas)
* Removed duplicate entries and handled missing/null values.
* Standardized naming conventions, date formats, and categorical values.
* Resolved inconsistencies across related columns (e.g., customer IDs, product names).

#### Data Merging (Pandas)
* Applied appropriate join strategies (inner, left) to create a single, clean, unified dataset.
* Carefully maintained relational integrity between tables (customers, sales, products, etc.).

#### Data Transformation (Pandas)
* Created new calculated columns for future analysis (e.g., total order value, profit margins).
* Optimized column types for efficiency and readability.

#### Exporting Cleaned Dataset
* Saved the cleaned and merged data for further SQL analysis and visualization.

### Key Focus Areas & Deliverables
* Structured, well-documented data cleaning process.
* Efficient data merging across multiple relational datasets.
* Clean dataset prepared for SQL queries and Power BI dashboards.
Demonstrated understanding of relational data modeling in Python.
